## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require drewroberts/media
```

### Environment variables (Cloudinary Laravel v3)

Add your Cloudinary credentials to your `.env` file. Choose one of the following options:

Required (single URL form):

```
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=
FILESYSTEM_DISK=cloudinary
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You can get your credentials from your [Cloudinary console](https://cloudinary.com/console).

### Configure the Cloudinary disk (required)

Add a `cloudinary` disk to your `config/filesystems.php`:

```php
return [
    ...
    'disks' => [
        ...
        'cloudinary' => [
            'driver' => 'cloudinary',
            'key' => env('CLOUDINARY_KEY'),
            'secret' => env('CLOUDINARY_SECRET'),
            'cloud' => env('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
            'url' => env('CLOUDINARY_URL'),
            'secure' => (bool) env('CLOUDINARY_SECURE', true),
            'prefix' => env('CLOUDINARY_PREFIX'),
        ]
    ]
];
```

> The package expects `filesystems.disks.cloudinary.cloud` to be set. If missing, URL helpers will throw an informative exception.

### Media package config (optional)

This package ships with `config/media.php` for its own options. You can publish and customize it:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=media-config
```

Available options and defaults:

```php
return [
    'transforms' => [
        'cover' => 't_cover',
        'cover_placeholder' => 't_coverplaceholder',
    ],

    // Relative path; wrapped with url() in code when no image exists
    'fallback_image' => 'img/ogimage.jpg',
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> In your Cloudinary console, create a Named Transformation called `t_cover` sized to 1200x630 pixels. This package references that name to render cover images.
>
> Create another Named Transformation `t_coverplaceholder` sized to 120x63 pixels. This is intended as a lightweight loading placeholder, while the full `t_cover` image can be lazy-loaded by the frontend.

## Migrations

This package auto-runs its migrations and does not publish them.

The following tables are created:

- images
- videos
- tags
- taggables

Note: Because migrations are auto-loaded, you donâ€™t need to vendor:publish them. If you need to customize the schema, override with your own migrations in your application.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
